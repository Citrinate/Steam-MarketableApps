### Description

A list which contains all of the AppIDs for games with marketable trading cards, and none of the AppIDs for games with unmarketable trading cards.  Some of the AppIDs on the list may not have trading cards at all.

This is used to determine if a game's trading cards are marketable or not.  If the game's AppID is on the list then they're marketable.  If it's not on the list then they're unmarketable.

This list automatically updates every hour.

> [!NOTE]
> It will take ~4 hours from the time when a game's cards become unmarketable until its AppID is removed from the list.
