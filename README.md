### Description

A list which contains all of the AppIDs for games with marketable trading cards, and none of the AppIDs for games with unmarketable trading cards.  Most of the AppIDs on the list don't have trading cards.

This can be used to determine if a game's trading cards are marketable or not.  If the game's AppID is on the list then they're marketable.  If it's not on the list then they're unmarketable.

The list automatically updates every hour.
